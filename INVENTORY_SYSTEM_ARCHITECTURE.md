# Inventory Management System - Architecture Overview

## System Overview

The Liquor POS Inventory Management System is a comprehensive solution that provides real-time stock tracking, automated daily stock calculations, and detailed reporting capabilities. The system ensures data integrity and consistency through automated stock progression and reconciliation features.

## Core Features

### 1. Stock Tracking Logic
- **Opening Stock**: Automatically calculated as the previous day's closing stock
- **Stock Inward**: Records incoming stock with supplier details, batch numbers, and expiry dates
- **Sold Stock**: Automatically updated from sales transactions
- **Closing Stock**: Calculated as Opening Stock + Stock Inward - Sold Stock
- **Daily Persistence**: All stock movements are stored day-wise for historical tracking

### 2. Reports Generated
- **Day-wise Sales Report**: Product-wise sales with opening/closing stock and sales amounts
- **Inventory Report**: Complete inventory status with stock movements and values
- **Stock Reconciliation Report**: Physical vs system stock comparison with variance analysis

### 3. Data Persistence
- **Daily Stock Records**: Automatic creation and maintenance of daily stock snapshots
- **Stock Inward Transactions**: Complete audit trail of all stock additions
- **Reconciliation Records**: Physical stock count data with variance tracking
- **Historical Data**: Full retention of all stock movements for reporting and analysis
